# Elevator APP

This is a simple implementation of an elevator.

after cloning the repo just go to terminal and:

> rake test RAILS_ENV=test

> rake db:setup

> rails server

open your browser and go to [localhost](http://localhost:3000/)

Instructions

 * You can call the elevator from any floor using the buttons UP or DOWN
 * Select one or more floors to go using the elevator key pad.
 * Press the button "Move if Needed" to make the elevator work. It will move if needed up or down ONLY one floor.
 * Select one or more floors to go (again)
 * Keep pressing the button to continue moving the elevator. It is a manual elevator :P
